please do the following and be prepared to share and discuss during our next
class.

Submit detailed answers to these in this file via a pull request.

-   A wireframe of what your game project will look like.

 Wireframe in notebook.
-
-   The data structure you plan to use.

I plan on using a stack.

-   How you will take the markup of the game board and represent it in JS
-
-  I plan on using jquery w/ js to trigger events on the game board.
-
-   How you plan to approach this project.

 I plan on using the boggle logic paired with the sign-in, sign-out, etc lessons, html doc, and bootstrap to make this project.
-   4-8 user stories for your game project.

- As a user, I want to enter moves on a game board so I can play TTT.
- As a developer, I will code all possible moves to respond to the user to make a functional game.
- As a developer, I will use http verbs so the game history and user id can be stored.
- As a developer, I will use html and bootstrap so I can make a stylish and easy to use interface.
-
-   How you plan to keep your code modular.

I will make my code modular by using the book database and sign in page code as examples. I will program code that is in different modules, like index.js and api.js, but will not make these modules dependent on each other. I will have a model layer that handles data and a view layer that reads from the models. That way, I can refactor code and test it with more ease.

-   What creative spin will you add to your project.
-
-  I will try to code color commentary into the project if I have time. If there is no time for that, I will try to creatively stylize my interface.
-
- How you will use version control to backup / track your project.
-
- I will use different branches and commits to backup and track my project.
-
-   Do you plan to attempt any of the bonuses.

After talking to GA 11, I will try to first and foremost do the minimun reqs, then will blast off to bonusland.
